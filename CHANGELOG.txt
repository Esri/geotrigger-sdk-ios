iOS SDK Changelog
=================
[1.1.0] - 9/12/2014
- Added AGSGTGeotriggerManagerDelegate protocol as an alternative to using the
block properties on AGSGTGeotriggerManager.
- Added support for getting a single location update from the device on demand
and sending that to the server. See https://developers.arcgis.com/geotrigger-service/ios-reference/Classes/AGSGTGeotriggerManager.html#//api/name/requestOnDemandUpdate
for details.
- Enable silent push notification support.
- iOS 8 compatibility fixes. NOTE: You will need to have an entry in your
Info.plist with the key "NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription" and the value being
the text you want shown when iOS prompts the user for permission to use
location for your app. Without this key your app will not be able to receive
location data from the device!
- Various performance improvements and minor bug fixes.

[1.0.0] - 2/18/2014
- Changed AGSGTGeotriggerManager's setupWithClientId:... methods to make them
easier to use/take fewer parameters in the majority of use cases. See
documentation for the new forms. NOTE: This is a breaking change, you will
need to replace any previous setWith calls with the new ones if you were using
them in the Beta.
- Added AutoSetupMode. This mode sets the GeotriggerManager up as the
Application Delegate and forwards all ApplicationDelegate methods to the
current UIApplicationDelegate. This allows the GeotriggerManager to
automatically handle push notification registration and handling. You can
enable/disable this functionality with [AGSGTGeotriggerManager
sharedManager].autoSetupModeEnabled.
- Removed some unneccessarily public classes.
- Cache location updates to a separate file, instead of NSUserDefaults.
- Did an overhaul of Log statements and their log levels.
- Various battery efficiency improvements.
- Various bug fixes.

[0.2.1] - 12/20/2013
- Fixed bug causing the sharedManager property to be nil in the completion
block of setupWithClientId:(...).
- Only display an alert from handlePushNotification: when there is alert text
in the userInfo data payload.
- Add some additional log messages to the debug log level, and move some log
messages from the debug log level to the info level.

[0.2.0] - 12/10/2013
- Fixed bug making the SDK unable to send nested JSON arrays to the server (e.g. geojson polygons, esrijson).
- Added more logs, and move the log configuration calls to class methods on AGSGTGeotriggerManager. NOTE: This means you will need to change your calls from [[AGSGTGeotriggerManager sharedManager] setLogLevel:…] to [AGSGTGeotriggerManager setLogLevel:].
- Changed interface for turning on file logs to be a class method by itself on AGSGTGeotriggerManager. See [AGSGTGeotriggerManager enableFileLogging:].
- Changed handlePushNotification: to a class method on AGSGTGeotriggerManager as well. Also added a new method handlePushNotification:showAlert: to allow you to control whether or not the manager will display a UIAlertView when it handles the push notification. If you pass NO to this method and your app is launched after receiving a push notification that has a URL set, the SDK will immediately open the URL on launch rather than displaying an alert for the user to click view.
- Fixed various other bugs.

[0.1.2] - 11/26/2013
- Updated format of the console logs to be more friendly and informative.
- Removed some extraneous log entries (region monitoring) and added some more
useful ones (network request and response) to the debug log level.
- Added support for ObjC Modules and auto-linking Frameworks.
- Removed the need for the -ObjC linker flag in your build settings.
- Disabled pauseLocationUpdatesAutomatically in our instance of
CLLocationManager.

[0.1.1] - 11/20/2013
- Framework included in the previous build had an outdated binary. Updated
that.

[0.1.0] - 11/19/2013
- Public Beta release!
- Added configurable logging to AGSGTGeotriggerManager via the
setLogLevel:enableConsoleLogs:enableFileLogs: method.
- Fixed 64-bit compiler warnings, causing some interface changes (any method
that took `int` or `uint` parameters now take `NSInteger` or `NSUInteger`
- Various bug fixes.

[13.310 - 0.0.1] - 11/8/2013
- Added a podspec for the SDK. You can now link to the SDK by adding "pod
'GeotriggerSDK', :git => 'https://github.com/Esri/geotrigger-sdk-ios.git'"
to your Podfile and running 'pod install'. The :git portion of that will be
dropped once the spec is accepted into the official Cocoapods spec repo.
- Removed external dependencies. You no longer need to have AFNetworking or
CocoaLumberjack in your project.

NOTE: AGSGTApiClient used to inherit from AFHttpClient so if you were using
any methods other than postPath:parameters:success:failure: to communicate
with the Geotrigger Service API, they will no longer work.

The success and failure blocks' parameters of
postPath:parameters:success:failure: also took AFHTTPRequestOperation *request
as their first argument, so all existing calls to that method will need to be
changed. The request operation parameter was simply removed from these blocks.

If either of these are a problem for you please contact geotriggerdev@esri.com
and let us know which method(s) you were using on this class, or what you were
using the request parameter for so we can provide that functionality in a
future release!

[13.301] - 10/28/2013
- Added error parameter to AGSGTGeotriggerManager’s
setupWithClientId:trackingProfile:registerForRemoteNotifications:completion:’s
completion block. This will allow you to detect if the the AGO registration
calls errored out in anyway. NOTE: This is an interface change and will break
existing calls to this method.
- Added CocoaLumberjack logging library to the internal SDK. NOTE: This means
you’ll need to add “pod ‘CocoaLumberjack’” to your Podfile and run ‘pod
install’ again after upgrading to this version.
- Added deviceId property to AGSGTGeotriggerManager
- Fixed problem with handlePushNotification: method of AGSGTGeotriggerManager
after server update that moved where the text for the alert is located in the
notification, causing the alerts that this method showed to be empty.

[13.252] - 9/9/2013
- Fix bug causing auth tokens to not automatically retry the request after
refresh in some cases on start up.

[13.249] - 9/6/2013
- Enabled battery monitoring for location updates.

[13.248] - 9/5/2013
- Changed the didUploadLocations block property of the AGSGTGeotriggerManager
to pass in a count of locations uploaded rather than an Array of
AGSGTLocationFixes as the array was an inaccurate representation of what was
actually uploaded.
