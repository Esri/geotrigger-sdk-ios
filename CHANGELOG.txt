iOS SDK Changelog
=================
[13.310 - 0.0.1] - 11/8/2013
- Added a podspec for the SDK. You can now link to the SDK by adding "pod
'GeotriggerSDK', :git => 'https://github.com/geoloqi/Geotrigger-SDK-iOS.git'"
to your Podfile and running 'pod install'. The :git portion of that will be
dropped once the spec is accepted into the official Cocoapods spec repo.
- Removed external dependencies. You no longer need to have AFNetworking or
CocoaLumberjack in your project.

NOTE: AGSGTApiClient used to inherit from AFHttpClient so if you were using
any methods other than postPath:parameters:success:failure: to communicate
with the Geotrigger Service API, they will no longer work.

The success and failure blocks' parameters of
postPath:parameters:success:failure: also took AFHTTPRequestOperation *request
as their first argument, so all existing calls to that method will need to be
changed. The request operation parameter was simply removed from these blocks.

If either of these are a problem for you please contact geotriggerdev@esri.com
and let us know which method(s) you were using on this class, or what you were
using the request parameter for so we can provide that functionality in a
future release!

[13.301] - 10/28/2013
- Added error parameter to AGSGTGeotriggerManager’s
setupWithClientId:trackingProfile:registerForRemoteNotifications:completion:’s
completion block. This will allow you to detect if the the AGO registration
calls errored out in anyway. NOTE: This is an interface change and will break
existing calls to this method.
- Added CocoaLumberjack logging library to the internal SDK. NOTE: This means
you’ll need to add “pod ‘CocoaLumberjack’” to your Podfile and run ‘pod
install’ again after upgrading to this version.
- Added deviceId property to AGSGTGeotriggerManager
- Fixed problem with handlePushNotification: method of AGSGTGeotriggerManager
after server update that moved where the text for the alert is located in the
notification, causing the alerts that this method showed to be empty.

[13.252] - 9/9/2013
- Fix bug causing auth tokens to not automatically retry the request after
refresh in some cases on start up.

[13.249] - 9/6/2013
- Enabled battery monitoring for location updates.

[13.248] - 9/5/2013
- Changed the didUploadLocations block property of the AGSGTGeotriggerManager
to pass in a count of locations uploaded rather than an Array of
AGSGTLocationFixes as the array was an inaccurate representation of what was
actually uploaded.
